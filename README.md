## Quickstart (Docker)

Run the Ambulance Booking System locally using Docker:

---

## Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

A basic Jenkins pipeline automates the build and run steps:

1. **Checkout:** Clone repo from source control.
2. **Build Docker Image:** Build as `ambulance-booking`.
3. **Run Container:** Bind container port 80 to host port 8080.

> Setup: Point your Jenkins job to this repo and run the included `Jenkinsfile`.  
> You can extend this pipeline with stages for testing, cleanup, image publishing, and production deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (mobile-first, themed), JavaScript, Leaflet/OpenStreetMap
- **Container:** nginx (alpine)
- **CI/CD:** Docker, Jenkins (with Docker Pipeline plugin)

---

## Customization

- Edit `/src` files to update visuals and UI.
- Add backend by integrating a REST API and updating frontend logic.
- For production, add authentication, booking persistence, dispatch systems, and analytics.

---

## Next Steps

- Enable authentication and enforce secure data management.
- Connect a backend for real ambulance dispatch and live tracking.
- Extend CI/CD: Push images to a registry, automate testing, and use blue/green or rolling deployment strategies.
